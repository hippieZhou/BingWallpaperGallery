  "description": "National Hiking Day is more than a date—it's an invitation to step away from screens and into the rhythm of nature. This day celebrates the simple act of walking under open skies and reminds us that health and happiness often begin with a single stride. From the rolling hills of the Lake District to the rugged cliffs of the South West Coast Path, Britain's trails are diverse. The Peak District was the country's first national park and remains a hiker's favourite. Meanwhile, Snowdonia National Park in Wales promises climbs that make your calves burn.",
