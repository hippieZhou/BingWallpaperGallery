  "description": "Gwalior, in Madhya Pradesh, is not just a city; it is a chapter of India's history. Towering over the skyline, Gwalior Fort is a 6th-century hill fort shaped by generations of rulers and wrapped in legend. Nicknamed 'the Gibraltar of India,' this fort was praised by Mughal emperor Babur as the 'pearl among the fortresses of Hind' for its strength and grandeur. The fort has seen rulers from the Tomars to the Mughals and is linked to battles, royal intrigue and hidden treasures.",
