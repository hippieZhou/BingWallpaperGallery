  "description": "Few cities carry their past vividly as Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh. Towering over its skyline, Gwalior Fort is a 6th-century hilltop stronghold. Nicknamed 'the Gibraltar of India,' this fort was praised by Mughal emperor Babur as the 'pearl among the fortresses of Hind' for its strength and grandeur. The fort has witnessed rulers from the Tomars and the Mughals to the Scindias, each leaving echoes of their reign, and remains tied to tales of battles, royal intrigue and whispered treasures.",
