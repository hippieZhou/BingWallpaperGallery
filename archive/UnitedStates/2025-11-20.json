  "description": "On the lawns of the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, two children lean over a blank page, sketching the world as they dream it could be. This scene unfolds in 'World in Progress II,' a monumental land art painting created by Swiss-French artist Saype in 2020. Made with biodegradable paint, the artwork depicts the vision and innocence at the heart of World Children's Day—a spirit mirrored in today's featured image. Look closer, and you'll spot the artist himself posing with his artwork.",
